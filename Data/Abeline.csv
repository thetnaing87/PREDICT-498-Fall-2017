I also ordered a strawberry lemonade and it is coming out well. They also, importantly, didn't forget my sauce. Very respectable workers too. Twuan, was absolutely friendly, fast and mindful. He gave me awesome service. I have nothing to complain about. Thank you.Ps: Aaron was awesome too]"

I had to repeat my order several times and they still forgot to give  me the large fries I ordered. The quality of food was poor. French fries were stale and cold and my sandwich was distasteful as well.The WORST PART OF ALL OF THIS IS... THE FOOD MADE ME VIOLENTLY ILL WITHIN HOURS OF EATING THIS SONIC'S DISGUSTING FOOD.I vomited for over 2 hrs off and on, which left me weak with a migraine the next morning.DO NOT EAT AT THIS SONIC!]"

Updated review]",[4.0 star rating],[Update : their service has gotten much better. The past 3 times they've gotten my order right and I'm impressed. The wait also hasn't been too long. Keep up the good work!]
3,[2/3/2017],[4.0 star rating],"[They were quick with my order and everything was correct which was great because I had some really hungry kudos. The food was hot still and tasted good. I had to ask for ketchup, but they were quick with bringing me some as well.]"
4,[7/31/2016],[4.0 star rating],"[I've come here a couple times and overall I have to say it's pretty good. My orders have been accurate and the food up to par with other chain locations. The servers have also been friendly. I didn't give 5 stars because a few times the wait has been long, but they are a busy location. Not sure why there's so many poor reviews here as I've never had a terrible experience.]"
5,[4/22/2017],[1.0 star rating],"[I don't know what's wrong with this place. Every time I go the food gets worse, and they screw up my order more times than not. The last time I went, the guy in the drive thru went over each item on my receipt with me and they still screwed up my order. I'm done going here.]"
6,[11/10/2015],[1.0 star rating],"[Highly upset this morning at the sonic on South Abilene... It is 7:12 a.m. sitting in the drive thru and the store is not open. I usually don't give 1 star....but when I call the sonic store, a Hispanic woman answer the phone and said : ""sorry no manager"".   I ask her when they are open...and she repeatedly said no manager....very upset!!!!!]"
7,[6/30/2016],[1.0 star rating],[Need to hire more people! Have better training to handle busy summer hours! My friend's order was lost completely from the computer system! How does that happen?]
8,[4/2/2015],[1.0 star rating],"[My experience at this specific location has been on the scale from 1 to 10  a 2  Be aware of the person at the drive-thru window. When paying with a credit card or cash be sure they hand you your credit card or cash before they hand you your food. They will keep your money or your credit card and lack the responsibility of giving it back before they give you your food. I am aware you are supposed to give the customer their money back before they get their food and this location fails every single time I've come here. Also be aware of the chicken popcorn, they are rock hard, the hamburgers are always premade and cold. I appreciate Sonic when the food is prepped right and you get what you pay for. But this location needs a lot of work and re-training.]"
9,[12/4/2015],[1.0 star rating],"[Horrible and rude customer service. They will lie to you so they don't have to make something and they over charge you. Go to another location, trust me. They told me they didn't make a cheesy bacon dog when it was advertised right on the screen I was looking at.]"
10,[2/20/2016],[1.0 star rating],[Ordered a 12 piece boneless wings... They literally cut 6 individual wings in half in order to make it a 12 piece. They did the same thing with my daughters 6 piece. Just cut 3 wings in half. I'll go to tower and hampden from now on.]
11,[6/10/2015],[1.0 star rating],[This location is awful went there twice two separate occasions and both times got our order wrong horrible service]
12,[6/18/2016],[1.0 star rating],"[Poor service. Attendant had attitude with us the whole time. We ordered 4 drinks, some buffalo wings and cheddar peppers. After ordering the two food items, we noted we'd like some ranch packets. Multiple times in fact. Upon receiving the food and drinks, there was no ranch in the bag, just one little thing of ketchup. Ketchup? With buffalo wings ? Or peppers ? But wait, there's more. We got no straws. So we pushed the button to ask for some straws and multiple ranch packets, and within 5 minutes, an attendant came out to us with straws, and ONE packet of ranch. Do you wanna share a tiny ass packet of ranch with 3 people ? Not really.]"
13,[4/29/2013],[4.0 star rating],[Always yummy! And super fast service. No matter if it's busy or not.]
14,[1/22/2015],[1.0 star rating],"[For as slow as the night crew moves, you'd think *no cheese* would be a request they could process. Every. Single. Time. And attitude when you confirm the order....and still, even with eye rolling confirmation, wrong. I just don't get it.]"
15,[4/14/2015],[1.0 star rating],[The whole chain of Sonic is not good enough to grace the fast food world.]
16,[1/30/2016],[1.0 star rating],"[Once again didn't get the extra fruit in my drink, which I asked and got charged for. I usually try to be more diplomatic, but there's no other way to put it -- this place sucks!]"
17,[6/6/2015],[1.0 star rating],[All bad workers nasty workers they need all new people.  I didn't get what I order so I took it back and they didn't even want to give me my money back don't go eat here u won't like it at all]
18,[1/27/2016],[4.0 star rating],"[Pulled up to the drive through mic and the gentle man that took my order was rude, demanding and kept saying, ""what else, what else"" while I was sitting there trying to look at the menu after I had said to give me a minute. But they all have headsets so I can't put a name on it. I come here all the time because it's the closet location to where I live, first time I had a problem besides them as a whole kind of being on the slow side getting the drive through going so you wait in line for a while before getting your food. Can't beat the happy hour though.]"
19,[6/8/2012],[3.0 star rating],"[If I could, and could afford Diabetes meds, I would get a Route 44 Vanilla Coke everyday both on the way to work and back again at night. I dont much eat here, with the exception of grilled cheeses, corn dogs, and drinks. I am not a fan of tater tots, or french fries from ANYWHERE. Although my partner likes the tots.The do have a set menu, and all sorts of choices, and even rotate a few season fare. Drinks half price 2-4 are always a plus. I do like to get odd drink combos but my favs are--vanilla coke-peach sprite-peach tea-vanilla dr pepper-cherry dr pepper-lemon cream slush-choco cream pie shake-powerade slushie-cranberry slushie was good, tart and cold!!!! good refreshing summer treat]"

21,[8/25/2013],[4.0 star rating],"[Another review of Sonic Drive Inn...a chain. (I know, I know...) But when I find something that is delicious, I must talk about it. Two words. Pretzel dog. I have tried the Wendy's pretzel bun on a hamburger. Meh. The hot dog is the perfect accompaniment. They slather it with cheese and bacon, which is awesome, but I think this dog can stand on it's own with spicy mustard. Amazing. This location on Abilene has never disappointed me, The sonic near my house, on Colfax near Peoria is terrible. The food is cooked wrong, or they miss parts of your order in the drive-thru. Our family has stopped going there. Which, goes to show you that even a chain restaurant can be good or bad, depending on the location. I hope the Colfax location improves, because it is so close to where we live.]"
22,[7/8/2012],[3.0 star rating],[Typical sonic.  I got my large Strawberry Limeade during happy hour for like $1.15.  This sonic was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon.]
