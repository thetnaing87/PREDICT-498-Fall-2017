2,[7/16/2017],[1.0 star rating],[Consistently the worst limeades I've ever had.  It just tastes like iced down carbonation.  Got one yesterday and it had 1/4 lime wedge for a 44 oz drink.]
3,[8/15/2016],[5.0 star rating],"[My favorite Sonic!  Awesome staff!  Always friendly and right on top of their game.  The manager Denise is wonderful and makes sure everything is running like a well oiled machine.  I stop at least once a day for a tea, and my mornings are always brighter because of the morning team, including Jen and Melissa and Shannon and the other awesome folks.  Only downside is I wish sonic had some lighter offerings... Salads etc.]"

The bun is great. More meat inside. Fresh toppings. I was really impressed for the price. Go Sonic! The chicken sandwich is good too!]"
5,[3/27/2014],[5.0 star rating],"[We visit this Sonic several times a week either for drinks, food or both.  Service is always quick and we've never had issues with the food.  Things can always vary with who's working but this is one of our favorite fast food places.]"
