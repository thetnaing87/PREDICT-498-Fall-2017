I asked for a route 44 raspberry sweet tea with an extra pump of raspberry and easy ice. They brought me a drink that was packed to the brim with ice. I asked the car hop to please correct it and she didn't even remake my drink, just scooped a little ice off the top and brought it back to me. I had to scoop out just about half of the 44oz cup worth of ice and my tea was so watered down. I go to sonic every day to get a drink for my mother and I and this location is seriously hit or miss. They need to retrain their staff to be friendly and actually caring to what the customer says rather than seeming to get the order and be done with them. It's ridiculous. I wasted my money on this drink that tastes like crap.""",,status,,2017-10-30 15:03:38,0,1,0

24540959832_10155273869494833,"b'Hello, my name is Kristi Riddle. I run a small town organization called Phil Campbell Christmas. We originally began our program in 2011 after a devastating EF5 tornado ripped our little Alabama town to pieces, leaving behind devastation and heartache. Six years later, we continue to rebuild and to grow. However, many that live in this town continue to be at poverty line or below and need help with day to day necessities. Many cannot afford Christmas for their children as after paying bills, expenditures for school, clothing, food, and gas, there really isnt much if anything left over to focus on Christmas presents for their children. This is where PCC comes in to try to help. We put children on the list and connect them with sponsors who purchase items for them, very similar to the angel trees done by other organizations. I am posting this message here in the hopes to gain followers who can share our posts, contribute to our cause, or sponsor our angels. Thank you for your time! \n\nWww.facebook.com/PhilCampbellChristmas'",b'Phil Campbell Christmas',link,https://www.facebook.com/PhilCampbellChristmas/,2017-10-26 14:23:48,0,0,1

Manager (Coby) initially refused to acknowledge that there was an issue, until I hopped out and took the attached picture.  He yelled at my husband and told him to either accept the price as it rang up, or move on.  He finally admitted the price on the menu was wrong, but said the computer price was correct and that's what he would be charging.  Ultimately, after asking to speak to his boss, he went off and apparently called someone above him and was 'given permission' to adjust the price.  \nI'm pretty sure it's illegal to advertise (on the menu) one price and charge another.   Of course, mistakes happen, and if the manager had apologized and adjusted the price, we would have certainly understood. Really, no big deal.

Notice the times on the receipt!! Ordered at 7:11, after waiting almost 5 mins after I pushed the call button. At 7:25(2 mins after they reprinted the order ticket), I pushed the call button again to obtain the order status. At 7:28, they finally answered the call, and then they had to locate the finished product, which was on the tray of a carhop across the way who just emerged from the kitchen with several orders. At 7:31, we finally received the concrete, which by then was the consistency of a milkshake.\nWhich brings me to another problem: they are advertising custard concretes; custard is supposed to be thicker than their normal ice cream. I've had my share of concretes from other places, and, after having eaten one of Sonic's previously and seeing Noah's, they are not using frozen custard. It appears to be just the same ice cream they use in their other desserts, but more expensive. To be fair, the day shift mgr was very helpful and apologetic  and ensured that the night manager would be after I relayed my frustration/displeasure earlier this afternoon. Sonic, these things are WAY overpriced; I can go to the locally owned ice cream shop and get a banana split that will feed 2 adults for less than what I paid for this sorry excuse for a concrete!! \nI will not be giving them any of my money for the next several months!""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209611394626600&set=o.24540959832&type=3,2017-06-07 14:23:36,0,1,0

After getting to the ordering spot we waited in line for almost 10 minutes.  I kept stepping out of the van to see if they were maybe helping other vehicles.  They went down a couple vehicles each time I looked until there was no one in the drive thru except us waiting to give our order. People were also lining up behind us.  After waiting another couple of minutes I thought maybe they couldn't talk to us so we pulled around.  After sitting there for a couple more minutes the girl making shake after shake totally ignored us.  Not once did she clean off anything when she put another shake to be mixed.  After looking a little closer I noticed that the place was trashed.  This is one photo of how bad the shake machine looked.  Disgusting to say the least.  We then looped around and got back in the drive thru.  At that point they must have decided to start taking orders again.  So at this point I am guessing that because they were busy they totally ignore us and a couple of other customers and just left us sitting.  Beyond the fact that this was very bad customer service people should beware because I really cannot imagine this being a sanitary. Not just because of how dirty things like this shake machine are, but because they are handling dairy products and not cleaning anything as they scramble to mix one shake after another.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10211899061648594&set=o.24540959832&type=3,2017-05-13 21:02:50,0,4,2

24540959832_10155173482515775,"b""Myself and 3 others arrived at the location at 1:30 in the afternoon. We spent roughly 20 minutes waiting in the drive through line with absolutely no explanation for the delay. After things started moving again we had been in line for almost half an hour and we were finally able to place our order while someone who appeared to be the manager interrupted our order with no communication to us and tells someone on the other end that the speaker is working and he then leaves still without mentioning a single thing to us or apologizing for interrupting our order or telling us who he was. We finish our order and pull around to the window and after almost another 10 minutes another employee walks out the side door asking for my payment. We decide to give her my credit card while asking what the delay was. We received no explanation and she walked off with my card. She came back with a receipt for $44.29 and required no signature which seemed odd since other places typically require that for anything over $25. We waited another 20 minutes and got to the window and were asked about what food we ordered. We told them our order and they still gave us the wrong food then asked for the food back and seemed to want to pass it on to whoever ordered it. We asked what the delay was and there still was no apology it explination and just said that we were talking to the GM. We asked what could be done for the inconvenience since we were now late for our plans by 45 min and he said he would speak to the owner and be right back. We waited another 10 min or so and got our food by another employee and were told that we would not get anything as their service was still up to par with what is to be expected and that the GM would not be coming back to speak with us. We checked our order and our shake was melted and our food was all cold and most of it was thrown away as none of us wanted to eat it by that point and my American dog was completely soggy and cold along with everything else. We were all excited to try sonic and now none of us think we ever want to go back as the hour wait in the drive through was horrible and the service was far from welcoming or friendly and the food was cold and soggy by that point. That might be the last time any of us go to a sonic restaurant and I feel like I completely wasted $44.29 on this food for everyone. There was not a single part of this experience that was good, pleasant or enjoyable. The picture I included is the rotten banana we also received in our shake and then 5 days ago I submitted a service ticket and your customer service has not yet reached out to me yet they sent me a feedback form asking how they did with finding a resolution to my issue. I understand part of that was the weekend but to not get any response by now other than an email survey that makes it sound like my issue was resolved is pretty messed up. I can't believe the horrible service I've received from sonic both at the restaurant and from customer service. That was my second time going in 2 years and now my friends and I are unsure we will ever go back... The first time wasn't bad but this time tells me that it's a mistake to go there. Personally, I'd like a complete refund for my meal as well both for the unbelievably horrible food we were given and if course the absolute worst restaurant experience any of us have ever had""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155173482515775&set=o.24540959832&type=3,2017-04-26 20:10:23,1,11,5

There is a reason why you don\'t see, let\'s say, an Einstein Bros. Bagels ad with Hitler and Himmler for a reason. I can see it now, Hitler is enjoying his bagel and he offhandedly remarks to Himmler, ""You know, it\'s hard to find a good bagel in Germany."" To which Himmler cattily replies, ""And whose fault is that?"" They both give a coy look and continue to finish their bagels. You won\'t see that anytime soon in a commercial and there is a good reason for that. This isn\'t a Sonics first stroll down the tasteless and insensitive trail.

While he may be easy to satire because was indeed a buffoon and fop... he used ""human shields"" as a battle tactic, charging Indian camps to take women and children at the start of battles... and killed the peaceful Cheyenne band led by Black Kettle just because they were the first Indians he came across at Washita, never bothering to determine if they were the warriors he had been sent after. They weren\'t. From an Indian perspective he deserves no respect and this commercial, though played for comedy, is highly distasteful. As an American Indian citizen living in the very state that the Washita Massacre happened in, I find it an affront that a county is named for him and unconscionable that one of our great Oklahoma institutions, Sonic, should use him in a commercial. Shame on Sonic. Stop the commercial immediately, tender an apology and help petition the state to change the name of Custer County...

24540959832_10158467298730424,"b""This is absolutely unacceptable and revolting. On my way home today during a 4 hour drive, I made the willing choice to go several travel minutes out of my way to eat at Sonic in Hannibal, MO because I know I will have a quality visit each time I stop. I drove past Hardee's, McDonalds, and KFC to spend my dollars at Sonic. I will provide the receipt in the comments with details of my order and which exact store this happened at. Knowing I had a couple more hours left in my drive, I gladly made the choice to take the time to stop, shut off my truck, order my usual food and beverage choice, and relax for a moment before I began my drive again. I didn't receive bacon on my sandwich as I had requested, but at the moment it didn't bother me as I would have rather eaten the sandwich than spend more time waiting for a replacement. After eating my sandwich, I got back on the road so I could arrive home before dark. However, after I ate my fries, to my utter horror I found this bobby pin in the bottom of the fry container. I have NEVER been more disgusted in my entire life. A customer should NEVER find this kind personal item in their food and there is not an excuse sufficient enough to explain how or why this might have happened. And for me to find this AFTER I have eaten all of my food, figuratively and literally, makes me sick. I had only taken a few sips of my Diet Coke, and none of my coffee; I consequently did not consume any more of either of my drinks. Which was very disappointing as I was thoroughly looking forward to drinking my coffee as I completed my traveling. \n\nAgain, there are no words to describe how truly horrid this is. Whatever cleanliness standards may be in place are clearly not being followed. And as a brand that is known for quality and convenience in the food service industry, this is a despicable piece of evidence which negates everything Sonic stands for.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158467298730424&set=o.24540959832&type=3,2017-03-26 21:01:36,2,13,0

If you don\'t know, find someone who does and ask them so that I don\'t have to! My question is this: If the frozen lemonade ""includes one flavor add in"" like the menu states, then why would I be charged extra for said flavor add-in. I understand flavor add-ins are only 20 cents, but when I read that a large frozen lemonade costs 2.79 AND ""includes one flavor add-in"" I EXPECT to pay 2.79 for the drink INCLUDING the flavor add in, NOT 2.79 plus 20 cents for the flavor add-in right?! Apparently not, and the manager didn\'t have an explanation aside from ""I don\'t know sir, that\'s just how we\'ve always rung it up."" But it\'s wrong, and either an entire chain of menus needs to be fixed or the staff needs to be certain of how to properly ring up a drink. Even IF I were wrong in the situation, the way most places would handle it is to honor the menu as advertised and explain the misunderstanding to avoid a repeat scenario. A simple ""I don\'t know"" isn\'t good enough so I\'ll be waiting for a coupon and/or valid explanation from corporate.

Parmer Lane in Austin Texas 78717.  On Friday, Oct. 21st., My family and I stopped here for drinks. There were six of us, and it was not a difficult order. Yet the young woman taking the order, continually got it wrong, and she started to become agitated after the third attempt. We waited 21 minutes, while people around us were driving up, ordering, and receiving their orders. We had already paid, and my grandkids were thirsty, so my son went to find out what the problem was. He was met with arrogance and disinterest, even by the manager! There was one young man working that took it upon himself to help us by refunding our money. This was the first and only time we have had trouble at a Sonic, but the worst experience of anywhere that we have gone at any time.\nStay away from this location.""",,photo,https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10209886952042477&set=o.24540959832&type=3,2016-10-25 11:00:52,2,1,0

We are requesting that memos be given to their managers, employees, and all franchises, to make it clear that refusing service to or verbally abusing our LEOs and Veterans in uniform, will not be tolerated! We are asking that employees be dismissed immediately for these actions! A public restaurant is not an appropriate place to push a racist and violent agenda towards LEOs or Veterans. We have drafted a list of chains with their FB pages that need to be contacted by as MANY people as possible. We have also, drafted a cover letter to copy and paste on their FB pages to make this as easy as possible. If there are others that we have missed please feel free to contact them as well and post the letter to their FB page.

Unfortunately, in recent weeks, we have become aware of Employees and Management of many 'fast food' stores disrespecting Police Officers and Veterans in uniform by writing notes on food packaging and verbally refusing service to Police Officers and Veterans while on duty and in uniform. In addition, your attorneys should brief you on the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which in effect, allows an on-duty officer to open carry in any place that it is not prohibited or restricted on government property. All your employees should be made aware of this law! As Americans, and Veterans, we stand with millions of Americans who see this behavior as unacceptable! We are requesting that all fast food and dine in chains send memos to all store Managers, Employees and Franchise Owners, and adopt a company policy of immediate dismissal of any Employee found to have committed this discrimination or harassment. Our goal, is only to get cooperation, but as we have seen, such incidents can lead to Boycotts and Nationwide outrage. We would like to think that the customers who support your business are ALL important to you. Those who put their lives on the line for our safety and freedom deserve respect from all who live under the veil of their bravery and sacrifice. We are requesting a response to let us know that you have addressed this issue, and that your employees have been informed of your policy, or change in policy...Thank you Sincerely for your cooperation in this matter.\n Your Customers""",b'Red Lobster',link,https://www.facebook.com/redlobster/,2015-10-18 14:14:23,0,0,0

I wonder what could have possibly taken so long. Couldn\'t have been the fact that they were all jackin around and not paying attention to ANY of the customers, and obviously into some pretty intense conversations on their phones. I could be wrong... Maybe it took so long because they had to go chisel the ice off a block and hand make the lemonade with a homemade cherry syrup. \xf0\x9f\x98\x91 FORTUNATELY..... We live in America, where the portions are too big and cherry limeade comes out of a spout connected to a wall. So naturally, one would anticipate this whole transaction taking less than 5 minutes. But instead, I was ignored when trying to place my order, then made to repeat myself 7 different times because ""I would like one route 44 cherry limeade"" is SUPER difficult to process and comprehend when in the middle of level 58 in Angry Birds and that conversation with your boyfriend.

24540959832_10204519052550202,"b""Me and my boyfriend were running errands on a hot day so we decided to give Sonic desserts a try. We pulled up to the drive thru and ordered two Butterfinger Blasts and an order of onion rings. After waiting in line for 20 minutes, we were worried our food would not be fresh and it wasn't. The onion rings weren't even luke warm and the ice cream was melted. We parked and I walked up to the side door to get new food. The employee was apologetic and went to replace our order. After about five minutes she returned with our food and we left. I opened my lid to my Butterfinger blast and took a couple bites, only to see something blue inside! I dug out a cap to a can of whipped cream! In my replacement Butterfinger Blast! I was horrified that after getting a complaint, someone should be so careless as to leave that in my cup! We did not return, nor did the employee return my receipt that I had given her at the time of my return. You would think with a wait time of 20 minutes, for $13 worth of food, they would consider that when starting a customer's order. One should also think that when replacing someone's food, they would make sure it was perfect! I still have the whipped cream cap and chose not to go back because I didn't see any employees over the age of 20 at the establishment.  I am still in shock that something like that was in my ice cream!

Today at 2:12PM I had placed my order and then noticed this and took a photograph. I then asked to see the manager (supposedly someone named Jeremy). The man walks out with a DUH look on his face, I asked if he was aware of proper American Flag edict and then promptly informed him of the proper way to handle the flag which did not include allowing it to touch the ground! I also said that if his intent was to destroy the flag that I would gladly put it in my own vehicle and make sure it would be destroyed properly. He said ""OK"". He then proceeded to walk back into the building and leaving the flag as seen in photo. A few minutes later, my food server came to my car with my order at which time I fully notified her that my intent was to return my order if that American Flag was not picked up NOW. She went in, the man came out, he picked it up and tossed it back onto the seat...just not touching the ground...where it dripped. Granted, it was wet, and it needed to dry. BUT it should have been carefully draped over the table and not tossed like a rag!! My father was a Marine, my brother a Marine, my cousin a Marine, my family has members in the Air Force....their coffins have and will be draped in this flag!

The person taking those orders didn't understand the issue so just asked for me to come to window. When I did get to window a young lady barely understood took the drink, handed it to the manager who snatched it from the young lady. A grill person came to look at who was complaining (me). While window still open the manager slammed my runny shake into a trash can and yell to the crew they needed to get their act together. The young lady handed me a new shake which was better. No one apologized, the professionalism was horrible, the service was nonexistent. Location was Mission Kansas I arrived at 8:15PM and it was 9:05PM when I finally pulled away from the drive thru window. Last night just for a simple medium hot fudge shake.

It was 9:40 AM so the 99 cent drink specials were on and each of us got a large drink. My daughter ordered a Strawberry Limeade (which by the way is not 99 cents cause they charge you extra for the ""flavoring"").  After we left the Sonic, she opened the lid so she could eat some of the strawberry pieces and she discovered this worm in the top of her drink.  Needless to say she did not drink anymore and was almost to the point of throwing up because she had already drank about half of it.  I called the 866 customer service number on the cup and a lady took my information and told me someone would be calling me from the location we visited.  It\'s been 3 days and I haven\'t heard from anyone.  We will not be going back to a Sonic any time soon!!!\n\nFeb. 6 - Update: To those asking which Montgomery location  -  it was the one on Atlanta Hwy across from Frazer UMC.  \nConcerning the response from Sonic - as of yet the only response I\'ve had from Sonic is the request on this post for my contact information, which I replied with a private message including my contact phone number. I did receive an acknowledgement to that message that it would be escalated to their team.  Since then I have not heard anything.  No phone call, text or reply.

On Tuesday, I called your local store to report finding TWO HAIRS in my tightly wrapped breakfast burrito from a Topeka, KS location. They basically just wondered what I wanted done...money back or replacement. I said I wanted to be assured that someone visited with the staff that day to make sure this was addressed for safety and sanity standards for your paying customers. The response while from a nice young female manager simply didn't address the issue. I then called your corporate office to share the incident and the handling of it. I was given a ticket number and told I would be called back in two days. No call came. Apparently, my not being able to eat all day Tuesday due to the fact that I found not ONE, but TWO hairs in my burrito were not a huge issue to you all. I never did go in to get my money back as that seems what you all consider a resolution. Here's my resolution as a once loyal customer, I will buy NO more food at Sonic. Drinks may be safe so I will try that. Thank you for caring and I hope that this will be shared with someone who does care. From a drinks only from now on customer, Kimberly Qualls (http://www.sonicdrivein.com/)   As I read this page, I notice that you don't respond on Facebook either to #customerservicefailure.

He and I were joking and playing because I wanted to keep the tricket, so he put it inside the driver side door where I couldn't reach since he was driving lol So after we got our food, he got out of the van real quick and the ticket evidently fell out. We didn't realize until we were well into the next town, that it was gone. Sonic was our last stop, we were sure it was gone but I convinced my husband to call and see if it was found. Guess what? They did find it and had it waiting for us! Not many people would turn it in but our Waitress Cindy did.

Now they are lazy, rude and could care less about your experience at their establishment. I've been going to this Sonic nearly 30 years and have always had good experience until the last year. Below is a picture of the 1.00 hotdog for Presidents' Day. We used to go here daily, sometimes twice a day. This evening was our last trip to a sonic until something is done.

A pro-life leader has won a victory in her efforts to convince soft-drink manufacturer PepsiCo to stop the use of aborted fetal cells in its research for enhancing the flavors of its products. Debi Vinnedge, executive director of Children of God for Life (COGFL), announced that in late April she had received a letter from Paul Boykas, PepsiCo\xe2\x80\x99s vice president for Global Public Policy, confirming that the company will not allow the use of HEK-293 \xe2\x80\x94 a cell line derived from human embryonic kidney \xe2\x80\x94 in its partnership with Senomyx, the company with which it had inked a four-year, $30 million contract for flavor research.\n\nAs reported last November by The New American, a PepsiCo shareholder had filed a resolution with the Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort halt the company from contracting with Senomyx, which, according to documents collected by Vinnedge, used cell lines derived from aborted babies in its process of producing artificial flavor enhancers. According to a report by LifeNews.com at the time, Pepsi had \xe2\x80\x9cignored concerns and criticism from dozens of pro-life groups and tens of thousands of pro-life people who voiced their opposition to PepsiCo contracting with biotech company Senomyx even after it was found to be testing their food additives using fetal cells from abortions.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBut after a nearly year-long campaign led by COGFL that included a nationwide boycott of PepsiCo products, in late April Boykas sent a letter to Vinnedge assuring her that PepsiCo would not \xe2\x80\x9cconduct or fund research \xe2\x80\x94 including research performed by third parties \xe2\x80\x94 that utilizes any human tissue or cell lines derived from embryos or fetuses.\xe2\x80\x9d Boykas also assured Vinnedge that \xe2\x80\x9cSenomyx does not use HEK cells or any other tissues or cell lines derived from human embryos or fetuses for research performed on behalf of PepsiCo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn response to the letter, Vinnedge said that she was \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely thrilled with PepsiCo\xe2\x80\x99s decision. They have listened to their customers and have made both a wise and profound statement of corporate integrity that deserves the utmost respect, admiration, and support of the public.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nVinnedge said that she had spoken personally with Boykas, who told her that in the process of internal discussions on the issue, company officials had recognized that it was not in PepsiCo\xe2\x80\x99s best interest to continue a policy that could hurt customer relations. \xe2\x80\x9cWe took the matter very seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d Vinnedge quoted Boykas as saying. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have an official statement on Responsible Research and we intend to live by that policy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe policy, Vinnedge explained, \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes any research by PepsiCo or third parties they fund from using human tissue or cell lines derived from embryos or fetuses.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNews of PepsiCo\xe2\x80\x99s decision reverberated through the pro-life community. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are grateful to PepsiCo, and especially to all those who sent a loud and clear message to the management of this company,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brad Mattes of Life Issues Institute, one of the over 30 groups that joined in the efforts to persuade PepsiCo to change its policy. He added that \xe2\x80\x9cthere are moral cell lines Senomyx can and should be using \xe2\x80\x94 not just for PepsiCo research but for all their customers.\xe2\x80\x9d Vinnedge noted that such usable cell lines could easily come from animals, insects, or even non-fetal human cells that express the \xe2\x80\x9cG protein\xe2\x80\x9d relevant for taste receptors.\n\n\n\nVinnedge said that beyond its contract with PepsiCo, Senomyx, which receives royalties for products sold using its ingredients, needs to rethink its use of aborted fetal cells in flavor research. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they do not use aborted fetal cell lines, they offend no one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they do, they most certainly offend at least half of U.S. consumers who are pro-life.\xe2\x80\x9d She said that \xe2\x80\x9cit only makes financial sense for both Senomyx and their collaborators to avoid a substantial loss of potential market. Senomyx needs to stop using the aborted fetal cell lines entirely and we will continue to pressure them to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe pro-life leader added that individuals and families who had boycotted Pepsi products over the issue should now write the company and thank its CEO for the ethical decision \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cand then go buy your favorite Pepsi products to celebrate!\xe2\x80\x9d Vinnedge said that \xe2\x80\x9ctoo often we seem to focus on the negatives and forget to take the time to let others know we appreciate their efforts. It is our sincere hope that the public will once again rise to the occasion en masse as they did in the boycott \xe2\x80\x94 but this time in appreciation and support of PepsiCo.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nYou can write to thank Pepsi on its website, or by mail to:\n\nAlbert P.

I ordered a large chili cheese tot with jalapenos and onion, and of course a Rt 44 cherry limeaid. I paid and drove off, without issue. Once I got on the road and took a sip, I found that my cherry limeade was mostly carbonated cherry syrup, and was very tart, instead of sweet. I went back, and got the same carhop that I complained to last time. I explained that I don't want to be a hassle again, but this time my drink was mostly carbonation.\n\nHe said he had to talk to the manager, and returned with a LARGE cherry limeaid, even though I had paid for a Route 44. He apologized and said he forgot to checl before going in, and thought I had a large. I said that even though I paid for a Route 44, I wouldn't make a big deal, since it was happy hour.\n\nThat, sadly, ended my long list of unpleasant visits to this location. I love you, Sonic, but if I can't get reliable service from this location at least 3-4/5 times, I will have to unfortunately take my hunger and my wallet elsewhere, at least when I'm in Taylor.""",b'Sonic Drive-In',link,https://www.yelp.com/biz/sonic-drive-in-taylor-2,2013-09-16 16:14:50,1,1,0

24540959832_10151488193906158,"b'Hey Sonic, I had a bad experience tonight, and wanted to pass on a comment about it.   First off, it\'s at your ""6202 BROADWAY BLVD. GARLAND, TX 75043"" location.\n\nIt\'s in regards to the Chocolate Cream Pie Shake.   My wife and I have been going to this sonic location for a really long time, over a decade.  We\'ve gotten a lot of drinks from there, and my wife\'s favorite has been the Chocolate Cream Pie Shake.   The last time I was there (a week ago or so), I got one, brought it home, and myu wife started drinking it, and said ""this isn\'t right"".  Looked at it, and she was right.   She drank it anyway, because it was home, but she said at the end ""I don\'t know what that was, but it wasn\'t Choc Cream Pie Shake"".  Up until that point, they looked mostly like the one on the link on your website which I have below. \n\nSo tonight I headed over to the same location to get one again.  One of the carhops walked one out to me along with one for myself (plain vanilla).  My wife had reminded me to check it this time before I left, and it\'s a good thing I did, because it certainly did not look right - AGAIN.  It looked honestly, mostly like the vanilla one i had ordered.  Previous to these last two attempts, the choc cream pie shakes looked like the one in the picture - mostly chocolate.  In fact, this one looked even worse than the last one, because the crumbs on the top were virtually non existent.  \n\nSo I told the carhop a shorter version of this story, and even showed her the picture which I had pre-loaded on my iPhone.  She kind of shook her head and said ""Well, I can get more chocolate mixed in on the top"", and that didn\'t address the problem of them being made incorrectly.  It\'s not that it\'s missing sprinkles on the top, it\'s not being made right.   I told her, ""Well, look at what is in your hand - you can\'t tell me that looks like the one on your own menu pictures"".   She shrugged her shoulders, and said ""Well, the store manager is the one making them"".  I said ""Well, the store manager is not making them right"". \n\nThe carhop asked me which one I wanted instead, and told her I didn\'t want any of them, and drove off.  That\'s the first time in a decade+ of going to this location that I ever drove off like that. \n\nThe problem is that they USED to make them right.  They haven\'t for the last two times, and if the store manager truly isn\'t doing them right, then it\'s time to find another place for shakes.  Shame, as my wife really liked that item.\n\nI\'m posting this so that perhaps some word could be gotten to the people in charge there, and they can make their drinks look the way they\'re supposed to - and not try and blow them out the door quickly because there\'s half a dozen cars in line.  Make them right, or don\'t make them at all.\n\nhttp://sonicdrivein.com/MenuItem/frozen-zone/real-ice-cream-shakes/chocolate-cream-pie-shake'",b'Chocolate Cream Pie Shake | SONIC\xc2\xae Drive-In',link,http://www.sonicdrivein.com/MenuItem/frozen-zone/real-ice-cream-shakes/chocolate-cream-pie-shake,2013-05-30 23:22:02,0,2,0

Most businesses in Jacksonville were without electricity for several days.  We own a business next door to Sonic and our numbers are down too.

These were not something Charles could control but had to deal with.\r\n\nNow I will tell you that many of us will drive clear across town to eat at the Sonic Charles has managed for years rather than go to the one on Main Street.  Why?  Service, service, service.  Charles keeps his staff moving, always on their toes.  No one ever waits more than a couple of minutes for orders.  I pull my hair out waiting at the Main Street Sonic and never go there unless absolutely necessary.  Also my order is always correct, the premises are neat and clean, the staff acts professionally.

Call me sensitive, but having this message be one of the few to actually come through during this tragic time really infuriated me like you can not imagine.

Now you\'ve got the worst service imaginable. \n\nMy family visited the Sonic in Princeton, WV tonight - ordered two #10 chicken strip meals, two chicken strip Wacky Packs, and a #7 meal. Not hard. When the carhop brought our order out, I noticed right away that the kids\' drinks are now half the size that they used to be. Then my kids started telling me that they had no toys in their Wacky Pack bags, so I said to the carhop, ""The kids didn\'t get their toys...""\n\nAnd she replied, ""We\'re out of toys."" I asked why the order taker didn\'t tell us that when we placed the order, and she said, ""We\'ve been out for weeks.""\n\nAfter a bit more back-and-forth, she told me that they had been giving out coupons to make up for it but that they\'d run out of coupons too. Really?\n\nHas Sonic decided that advertising toys, charging more for the food in a Wacky Pack, and then not delivering the toy or anything to replace it is a-okay?

I gave my money to the girl at the window and told her to have a nice night but the door was already closed, like I wasn't even there and she didn't give me my receipt. Halfway home, I eat the blast and realize it's not quite right...they made two milkshakes. I called to see if I could get a new one, but the guy rudely said I couldn't because I didnt have a receipt (mind you I never received one). My friend called up there and the same guy answered (the manager as it turns out) to politely complain. They found my order on the log and said I could come back. I got the Sonic blast and the guy asked for my messed up order and told me to take the straw out (didnt even off me a new straw!).

So we left and went to another Sonic and they had no problem serving us. So we returned to the other sonic to get the store information and the assistant general manager seemed very surprised to see us. When asked for the informants on for the corporate office and manager Loyd did not want to give us the information. After 10 minutes we finally got the information but still no apology. We will be calling the office. Very sad Lloyd, very sad. An apology would have been what you needed Loyd but fortunately there is another sonic just up the road.

Ordered xl Coney, 3 Popcorn Chickens, medium tater tots, sweet tots, & 2 hot fudge sundaes. When told the total, I knew it was too much. Told the order taker the chicken was $1.99 & that it sounded like he was charging the regular price of $2.99 instead. Hard to understand the mumbled speech thru the speaker.\n\nWhen the order came out, the chicken showed $8.97 for the 3, not $5.97. Told the waitress they had made a mistake & the chicken was the wrong price. She went back in to talk to the manager. She came back & told me she could refund the $22.01 to my card & re-charge it at the correct price, & that I would get my money back in about 5-7 days. Or they could give me another food item worth about $3. I told her that was not acceptable, that they should just give me my $3.28 & let me go. She went back in to talk to the manager. \n\nThen HE came out & gave me the same options. He said they had policies in place, & he couldn't just give me my money back. other than the way I outlined above. All the while, my food was getting cold & my sundaes were melting. I said I shouldn't have to wait a week for my $22 because of THEIR mistake. He said it was the first day of the promo, & half the staff didn't even know about it yet. (At this point, I thought, but didn't say, that THAT was HIS fault for not training his staff.) \n\nHe finally said he would have to go call HIS manager, & he went back inside. Finally, he came back out & gave me my money. When I got home the chicken was barely warm & was overcooked to the point of being too hard to eat. And the sundaes dripped on my clothes as I was getting out of the car. \n\nI don't usually have any problem with the food or the service at Sonic, but THIS trip was unbelievable! I hope SOMEBODY trains the staff about what the promos are, & trains the cooks to NOT overcook the food. Based on this visit, I was NOT impressed with this chicken. And I DEFINITELY can't see paying $3.19 for sweet potato tots when the same volume of regular tots costs $1.69 - the sweet tots are overpriced.\n""",,status,,2012-02-27 23:00:46,0,15,0

24540959832_10150476281479833,"b'Dear Sonic, my wife and I just drove across the country for Christmas and stopped at a half dozen Sonic\'s for drinks and food. We noticed that you\'ve stopped giving the regular peppermints and have begun handing out cheap imitation mints. Was this a cost-cutting measure, because the new mints are gross. They dissolve in your mouth in seconds and taste like chalk. The well-known Sonic mint is the ""cherry on top"" of the Sonic experience.

I'm wondering if I can sue you for trying to sabotage my weight loss efforts. Secondly, I know for a fact that you have received LOTS of business since I ate my first Chicago dog, not only by me, but by the many, many Coastians that have tried it on my recommendation. I am willing to settle with you for the weight loss sabotage if you will just offer me free hot dogs. I am not looking for a lifetime commitment of free hot dogs but maybe 6 months worth.

Over the years I became more than just the camera keeper; I became his friend and constant companion. I was even there when he met the love of his life, whom he would go on to marry. His wife embraced me with open arms. They took me on their romantic getaways to places like Mexico, The Domincan Republic, New York, Fiji, Chicago, the list goes on and on. However, I was most honored when they asked me to be the ring bearer in their wedding this past spring. It was an honor that may never be topped. Sadly however, I have been seperated from them... our last and possibly final adventure together was to Austin City Limits Music Festival, where I was kidnapped. While I may never be reunited with my owners, the void my absence leaves behind needs to be filled. Can you please find them a replacement?\nWith hope,\nTot'",,status,,2010-10-21 16:43:25,10,3,0

I just transferred back to my first store..and i'm wondering if anyone is dealing with what i'm dealing with.  Different stores in one are doing different things.  like using lime juice or the lemonade in their drinks along with or instead of the real fruit, as they are called Real Fruit drinks and slushes.  Or discrepencies of what type of boat to use for the chillie pies.  Or even down to promoting the BOGO shakes.  I dunno, i'm just wondering what everyone else's stores do as far as basic funcitons and stuff.  Cause it's confusing, and the GM wants me to help 'clean house' and bring business back.""",,status,,2010-06-20 20:41:02,0,4,0

Seems like you are trying NOT to make money!!  The worse part is they told us to leave, but not when to go back.\n\nAt least when they opened an ""In N Out burger"" in AZ (which was the first in AZ), they were ready to handle the number of people that showed up and were taking orders while cars were in line. No one was turned away, people just waited in line to get a good meal.\n\nHey Sonic, you should take some pointers!!!'",,status,,2009-06-21 19:05:37,1,0,0

More Sonics are in the planning stages here....always a good sign.'",,status,,2008-05-27 08:09:39,0,0,0
