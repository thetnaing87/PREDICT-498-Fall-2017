I told him that I\'m not holding on to spoiled food, and when I said that he was like, ""  Well I don\'t know what to tell you, I mean we need the receipt and food that\'s our policy.""

The cashier was pleasant but didn\'t give me my receipt.  While waiting a man who has gray hair and was dressed as if he might be the manager was coordinating the orders at the counter.  When I approached he didn\'t greet me or say a word until he plunked my large chili and 10 chicken nuggets on the counter with ""there\'s that.""  I was waiting for a apple pecan chicken salad and once ready he shoved it into the bag sideways, dropped the dressing packets on the floor, picked them up and put them in the bag with the salad.  I asked if he had the pecans in the bag and he did not, I asked if the requested sweet and sour sauce was in the bag and it was not.  I gave him the dressing back--I didn\'t want it but told him that I really didn\'t want it since it had been on the floor.  He threw them back in the cooler.  While I was waiting to order a young man was standing between the drive thru area and front counter and for about 20 seconds he worked on styling his manbun before going to work without washing his hands.  I though the manager was going to say something to him as he was nearby but did not.  To top it off, once I got home I had about 1/3 cup of water in the bottom of my salad container--I had to strain it to eat it.  I was really looking forward to the salad but this whole experience was the worst I\'ve had for a very long time.  Please respond with your remedy--like improved manager attitude or hire somebody who cares for a start.  I realize this may be a franchise unit but your brand is on the line.  I have reached out to the company about this situation 3 times but nobody seems to be concerned other that the Facebook monitor who\'s response was, ""Oh, no!, that is horrible!

We purchased four baked potatoes. My two older children and I ate our potatoes and thankfully my three year old refused hers. My eight year old was still hungry and started to eat into the remaining chive potato. However as she got about 1/3 of the potato eaten she found a bug right on the the edge of the inside and the skin. Upon further inspection, I found what appears to be a second ""baked"" bug on the outside of the skin as well. I called and explained the situation to the manager. They were less than helpful. After pressing, they said they would refund me the $1.59 for the single potato if I brought the potato back into the store as long as it was whole. Mind you, my daughter didn\'t see the bugs until she had eaten a portion of the potato. That in addition to the fact that I would have had to load my three kiddos back in the car and drive back to the store, wasn\'t worth the minimal refund or the hassle. I think we will just avoid Wendy\'s from here on out and give our money to places who offer better customer service.'",,status,,2016-12-19 21:59:45,0,0,0

I was the only customer inside the Wendy's there were approx 5-6 employees that were inside. I had to wait at least 5 minutes for the cashier to come and take my food order as she was in the back getting supplies, this was understandable, but once she took my order, the person that was to be making my burgers was on his phone, he was even told by someone in drive thru at one point, who I think may have been the manager but I am not sure, to take it in the back...this was his personal phone not the restaurant's phone, someone else was taking pictures with her phone & I was on my headset talking to a friend of mine who could here all the loud commotions and noises of the employees playing around and not working. The girl that took my order put my fries in a bag and left them under the light while the other guy that came from the back still talking on his phone started making my burgers, he messed them up and had to make them over as I watched him throw the buns away, both were without ketchup and one without tomatoes. He finally finished and put the burgers up to be bagged, which sat there another 2 minutes or so...by this time I was getting aggravated, and he asked are you waiting for these burgers to which I replied, I am not sure what I am waiting for, I am just trying to get my dinner. Someone else then said she is waiting on fries, I said no those are in the bags that have been sitting over there for 10 minutes, the cashier was now grabbing the fry bags and putting the burgers in them and the guy with the burgers said is there something wrong cuz your face looks like there is. I said I think it is a joke that you are on your phone, she taking pictures with hers and others are playing around while I am trying to get my food, he then said is there something wrong with your burgers, again I said I think this place is a joke to which someone else said and your ugly, I said excuse me? You are calling my ugly...give me my money back right now and I will be contacting Wendy's over this, he said no I was calling someone else in the back ugly....I said give me my money now....The same guy that had told him to go in the back with his phone was refunding me my money and then the burger guy came up and said I will be taking these and grabbed the bags off the counter, he said I will be throwing these away, and the manager or whoever he was that was, the drive thru guy that was refunding me my money said no don't throw that away we can use those fries. The cashier then counted out my money and took both receipts. I tried to get names but no one was wearing name tags that I could read. I had ordered a Single Combo and a Double with Cheese Combo both large and both with Frostys which I might add were not made either. I know that they will all get together and deny any of this, but if your cameras work there which they should, I want them pulled and you can see the way they were acting and carrying on and the person calling me ugly. I feel this is certainly discrimination against me. I am very upset and will never frequent that establishment or any Wendy's ever again and I will be letting everyone I know about this and putting it on Facebook as I am very mad.

The employees of this store were snide and condescending when my employee went back to redeem his compensated meal. It makes you wonder if they purposefully ""forgot"" our food that we paid for. I would hope not. Essentially this store\'s mistakes is costing my shop money since I\'m having to send our employees back and forth to correct these errors. Get it together! Unfortunately these experiences are enough for us to not come back again. Hopefully you can avoid these problems in the future to stop from losing even more customers.

113385204488_10154840932609489,"b""Good morning. I don't normally do things like this, but after my experience last night I think something needs to be said. I like Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s. The food normally always tastes fresh, and while it does typically take a few minutes longer than other fast food establishments to get my order, I understand that It is because the food cooked fresh, which I appreciate. Last night however was just terrible. I went to my local Wendy\xe2\x80\x99s at 1661 Hylan Blvd in Staten Island NY. It had been closed for a couple of months to undergo renovations and had opened back up this week. The new building and decor is beautiful, but that\xe2\x80\x99s where my good experience ended. I placed my order at 6:05pm. 2 fries, 2 sodas, a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger, and a Dave\xe2\x80\x99s Single with no cheese for $15. I then waited over 25 minutes to actually get my meal. There were several people there waiting as well. At one point they stopped taking orders for 15 minutes to allow the kitchen to push out the orders. The staff had no idea what they were doing. None of them knew how to use the screen that displays the orders. There was no system in place and the training of the employees proved to be minimal. After finally getting my 2 burgers and fries 25 minutes after ordering, I sat down and opened the packaging to see two identical small burgers with cheese, and nothing else. No lettuce, no tomatoes, no onion or bacon. 2 sad little cheese burgers are a far cry from a Jr. Bacon Cheeseburger and a Single with no cheese. On top of all that, the food was horrible. It tasted terrible. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened. We had a few bites and threw it out and left and went somewhere else for dinner. A big waste of 15 dollars. I hope this gets rectified soon, because everyone in that location yesterday was fed up, and if things don\xe2\x80\x99t change the business is going to suffer.""",,status,,2016-12-01 09:33:35,0,0,0

Pulled up to pay and saw your red key tag special. I realized it is for a wonderful charity, so I offered to buy several key tags for family members, as a way of helping out. As I paid for my food, I was told that I had to come back and order something off the menu in order to purchase the keytags. The explanation I was given was that there wasn't a lot of key tags and that Wendy's wanted to make certain that people purchased something when purchasing the tags.  I guess my $15 food purchase didn't mean that much to Larry, the person handling the transaction at the window. Really disappointed that I couldn't purchase the tag at that time and that if I want to help out I have to go back to the store.  Hate to see that is the way you handle assisting the foster care charities.  I'll find a way of helping out foster kids without your key tags.
